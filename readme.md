## Project Overview

**Project Name:** PLUS GOALS  
**Project Type:** E-learning platform  
**Description:** PLUS GOALS is an E-learning platform designed to help users improve their skills progressively through tasks and discussions. It includes user authentication, task progression, a discussion forum, user progress tracking, and responsive design.

## User Interactions and Data Flow

1. **User Registration and Login:**
   - Users sign up with their email and password or log in with existing credentials.
   - User authentication data is sent to the backend for validation.
   - If valid, the backend generates an authentication token and sends it to the frontend.
   - The token is stored on the frontend and sent with each subsequent request for authorization.

2. **Task Selection and Progression:**
   - Upon successful login, users are presented with a dashboard showing tasks categorized by difficulty levels.
   - The frontend requests the available tasks for the user's level from the backend.
   - Users select a task to complete, and their choice is sent to the backend.
   - The backend checks the user's progress and unlocks the next level if necessary.
   - User progress is updated in the database, indicating completed tasks and unlocked levels.

3. **Discussion Interaction:**
   - Users navigate to the discussions page to view existing topics and create new ones.
   - The frontend requests discussion topics from the backend.
   - Users can view and click on a topic to see its details and comments.
   - Users can create new topics and post comments.
   - Discussion data is stored in the database, including topics, comments, and user interactions.

4. **User Profile and Progress Tracking:**
   - Users can access their profiles to view their completed tasks and unlocked levels.
   - The frontend requests the user's progress data from the backend.
   - Users can update their profile information, which is sent to the backend for storage.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - The frontend layout adjusts based on the user's device and screen size.
   - Media queries and responsive design techniques ensure optimal viewing on different devices.

## Data Flow Diagram

User Interaction -> Frontend -> Backend (API Requests) -> Database
Database -> Backend (API Responses) -> Frontend -> User Interaction
```

1. User interactions are initiated by the user's actions on the frontend interface.
2. The frontend sends requests to the backend API endpoints for data and functionality.
3. The backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and sends appropriate responses.
4. The frontend receives responses from the backend and updates the user interface accordingly.
5. User progress, discussion data, and other relevant information are stored and retrieved from the database.

The data flow involves seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and database to provide users with a cohesive and interactive experience on the PLUS GOALS E-learning platform.
